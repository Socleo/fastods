/**
 * Writing a full documentation would be a considerable work, because every time you change the
 * library, you have to rewrite the doc.
 * My idea is to provide a set of examples of the features of FastODS.
 *
 * Before you start, add the following dependency to your POM (Maven users):
 *
 * ```
 * <dependency>
 * 		<groupId>com.github.jferard</groupId>
 * 		<artifactId>fastods</artifactId>
 * 		<version>0.6.1</version>
 * </dependency>
 * ```
 *
 * For other build tools, look at: https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.github.jferard/fastods/0.6.1/jar
 *
