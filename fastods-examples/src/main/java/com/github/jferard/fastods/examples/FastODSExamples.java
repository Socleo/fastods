/**
 * Writing a full documentation would be a considerable work, because every time you change the
 * library, you have to rewrite the doc.
 * My idea is to provide a set of examples of the features of FastODS. See the classes in this
 * directory
 * <p>
 * Before you start, add the following dependency to your POM (Maven users):
 * <p>
 * <pre>{@code
 *      <dependency>
 *          <groupId>com.github.jferard</groupId>
 *          <artifactId>fastods</artifactId>
 *          <version>0.6.1</version>
 *      </dependency>
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * For other build tools, look at:
 * https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.github.jferard/fastods/0.6.1/jar
