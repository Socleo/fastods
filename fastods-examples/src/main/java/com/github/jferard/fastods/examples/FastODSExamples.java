// >> BEGIN TUTORIAL (directive to extract part of a tutorial from this file)
// This tutorial is extracted from
// https://github.com/jferard/fastods/tree/master/fastods-examples/src/main/java/com/github
// /jferard/fastods/examples.
// See the classes in this directory for the full code.
//
// Writing a full documentation would be a considerable work, because every time you change the
// library, you have to rewrite the doc.
//
// My idea is to provide a set of examples of the features of FastODS.
//
// Before you start, add the following dependency to your POM (Maven users):
//
//      <dependency>
//          <groupId>com.github.jferard</groupId>
//          <artifactId>fastods</artifactId>
//          <version>0.6.2</version>
//      </dependency>
//
// For other build tools, look at:
// https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.github.jferard/fastods/0.6.2/jar
