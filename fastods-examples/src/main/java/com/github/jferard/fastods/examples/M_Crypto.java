        //
        // In LibreOffice, you can protect a file with a password. This is the "Save with password"
        // option in the *Save As* dialog box. Note that this has nothing to do with the "Tools >
        // Protect Spreadsheet/Protect Sheet" options. The "Save with password" option really
        // encrypts the data, while the "Protect Spreadsheet/Protect Sheet" options are easy to
        // bypass.
        //
        // The file encryption is regarded as robust: the key derivation function is PBKDF2 using
        // HMAC-SHA-1 and 100,000 iterations; the encryption algorithm is AES256 (Cipher block
        // chaining mode). To make a long story short: if you use a strong password and loose it,
        //
        // FastODS provides a `fastods-crypto` module (that has a dependency to Bouncy Castle APIs)
        // to encrypt an ODS file. *This module is still in beta version.*
        //
        // First, we create a simple document, similar to the "Hello, world!" example:
        final OdsFactory odsFactory = OdsFactory.create(Logger.getLogger("hello-world"), Locale.US);
        final AnonymousOdsFileWriter writer = odsFactory.createWriter();
        final OdsDocument document = writer.document();
        final Table table = document.addTable("hello-world-crypto");
        final TableRowImpl row = table.getRow(0);
        final TableCell cell = row.getOrCreateCell(0);
        cell.setStringValue("Hello, world!");
        //
        // Second, we save it with encryption. This is easy: the module provides a class
        // `ZipUTF8CryptoWriterBuilder` that implements `ZipUTF8WriterBuilder` and encrypts the
        // data:
        //
        final char[] password = {'1', '2', '3'};
        writer.saveAs(new File("generated_files", "m_hello_world_crypto_example.ods"),
                new ZipUTF8CryptoWriterBuilder(password));
        Arrays.fill(password, '\0'); // clear sensitive data.
        //
        // (The password in this example is "123", but you'd better choose another password.)
        //
        // << END TUTORIAL (directive to extract part of a tutorial from this file)
